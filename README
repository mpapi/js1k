A match-three game in under 1k of JavaScript.

http://js1k.com/demos#id782

- demo.html: the JS1k demo shim used for testing
- script.js: the original source (got kind of sloppy near the end)
- script.min.js: the minified source
- js1k.html: the page I threw up on the web for having friends test before submitting

It probably has a few bugs and could definitely lose a few more bytes
(getElementById, how silly).

I'd like to add animations eventually, even better if I can keep it under 1k in
the process.
